1. calculate the centroid coordinate of the triangles
2. calculate the distance between triangles based on the centroid coordinate
3. based on the critical value, tell whether two triangles are connected
4. iterate the triangles and get all the connected triangles pairs
5. based on the connected triangles pairs, build a graph
6. use union find algorithm to get all the connencted groups
